# shawpractical
Workspace for practical exercises in Bootstrap coding with integrated JS, jQuery, PHP, JSON, and Ajax.

This project will provide a solid understanding of the use and deployment of Bootstrap, along with JS, jQuery, and PHP integrations.
Designed in WebStorm on a local server for functionality testing.

Project is underway and in early stages, but is planned on being finished in the coming few weeks.  This will be a good base template for future projects to serve as a reminder about integration possibilities outside of a CMS.
